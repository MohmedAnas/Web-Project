## üöÄ How to Test the API

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/master73/RBComputer/backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Access API Documentation:**
   - Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/swagger/
   - ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc/

3. **Test Authentication:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login/ \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "admin@rbcomputer.com", "password": "admin123"}'
   ```

4. **Use the test script:**
   ```bash
   python test_api.py
   ```
